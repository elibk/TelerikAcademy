﻿// Write a program that applies bonus scores to given scores in the range [1..9]. 
//The program reads a digit as an input. If the digit is between 1 and 3, 
//the program multiplies it by 10; if it is between 4 and 6, multiplies it by 100;
//if it is between 7 and 9, multiplies it by 1000. If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, 
//the program must report an error.
