The most common relative directions are , , forward, backward, , and .
No absolute direction corresponds to any of the uprelative directions.
This is a consequence of the translational  invariance of the laws of physics: 
nature, loosely speaking, behaves the same no matter what direction one moves.
As demonstrated by the Michelson-Morley null result, there is no absolute inertial frame of reference.
There are definite relationships between the relative directions, however. Left and , forward and backward,
and  and  are three pairs of complementary directions, each pair orthogonal to both of the others.
Relative directions are upalso known as egocentric coordinates .
