Software ing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service 
under test.Software ing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the 
business to appreciate and understand the risks of software 88implementation. Test techniques include, but are not limited to, 
the process of executing a program or application with the 
intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects).
Software ing can be stated as the process of validating and verifying that a computer program/application/product:

   __ meets the requirements that guided its design and development,
   _works as expected,
    cantest be implemented with the same characteristics,
    and satisfies the needs of stakeholders.

Software ing, depending on the ing method employed, can be implemented at any time in the development process. 
Traditionally most OADSF the test effort occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed,
 but in the Agile approaches most of the test 098effort is on-going. As such, the methodology of the test is governed 
 by the chosen software development methodology.

Different software development models will focus the test effort at different points in the development process. 
Newer development models, such as Agile, often employ driven development and place an increased portion of 
the ing in the hands of the developer, before it reaches a formal team of ers. In a more traditional model, 
most of the test execution occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed.
