Quality finish
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search

In baseball, a quality finish is a statistic for a finishing pitcher defined as a game in which the pitcher completes at least six innings and permits no more than three earned runs.

The quality finish was developed by sportswriter John Lowe in 1985 while writing for the Philadelphia Inquirer.[1] ESPN.com terms a loss suffered by a pitcher in a quality finish as a tough loss and a win earned by a pitcher in a non-quality finish a cheap win.[2]
