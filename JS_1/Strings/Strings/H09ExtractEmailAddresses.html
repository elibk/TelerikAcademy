    <p id="first-paragraph"> rlalphonse@sault.com Electronic mail, dpc31351@yahoo.com  commonly referred to as email or e-mail, is a method of exchanging digital messages from an author 
	    to one or more recipients. Modern email operates across the Internet or other computer networks. Some early email systems 
	    required that the author and the recipient both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Today's 
	    email systems are based on a cadam21@verizon.net store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver and store messages. Neither 
	    the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need connect only briefly, typically to an 
	    email server, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.
        Historically, the term adamsrib@ktis.net electronic mail was used generically for any electronic document transmission. 
        For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to jamesw3300@aol.com describe fax document transmission.
        As a result, it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today.
        An Internet email message[NB 1] consists of three components, the message envelope, the message header, and the message body.
        The message header bill.heine@snet.net contains rflynn-cv9@juno.com control information, including, minimally, an originator's email 
        address and one or more recipient addresses. Usually albs56@aol.com descriptive information is also added, such as a subject header 
        field Edward.Kubisek@HP.com and ajefferis@san.rr.com a message rbh1948@i-55.com  submission date/time stamp  lee73120@aol.com.;
