    <p id="first-paragraph"> The most familiar palindromes, in English at least, are character-by-character: 
        The written characters read the same backward as forward. Some examples of common palindromic words: civic, radar, level, 
        rotor, kayak, reviver, racecar, redder, madam, malayalam, and refer. There are also palindromes where the unit of reversal 
        is the word ("So patient a doctor to doctor a patient so") or line (as in the poem "Doppelganger" by J.A. Lindon). These 
        are referred to as "word-unit palindromes" and "line-unit palindromes" respectively.[4] Word-unit palindromes were popularized 
        in the recreational linguistics community by J.A. Lindon in the 1960s, but occasional examples in English are found from at 
        least the 19th century, and several in French and Latin date to the middle ages.
        Some people have names that are palindromes. Included are given names (Ada, Anna, Bob, Aviva), 
        surnames (Harrah, Renner, Salas) or both (Eve, Hannah, Maham, Otto). Lon Nol (1913–1985) was Prime 
        Minister of Cambodia. Nisio Isin is a Japanese novelist and manga writer, whose real name (西尾 維新, Nishio Ishin) 
        is a palindrome when romanized using the Kunrei-shiki or the Nihon-shiki systems. (It is often written as NisiOisiN 
        to emphasize this). Some persons have changed their name in order to make of it a palindrome BB (one example is actor Robert Trebor),
        while others were given a palindromic name at birth (such as the philologist Revilo P. Oliver).
        Palindromic names are very common in Finland. Examples include Olavi Valo, Emma Lamme, Sanna Rannas, Anni Linna and Asko Oksa.
        There are also palindromic names in fictional media. "Stanley Yelnats" is the name of a character in Holes, a 1991 novel and 2003 film. 
        Four of the fictional Pokémon species have palindromic names in English (Eevee, Girafarig, Ho-Oh, and Alomomola).
